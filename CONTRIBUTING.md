## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

We use a structured commit message format aligned with [Epoch Semantic Versioning][2]:

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types

Types indicate the kind of change being made, aligned with Epoch Semantic Versioning:

- **epoch**: Major architectural or paradigm shifts (bumps EPOCH)
- **breaking**: Incompatible API changes (bumps MAJOR within current EPOCH)
- **feat**: New features (bumps MINOR)
- **fix**: Bug fixes (bumps PATCH)
- **perf**: Performance improvements (bumps PATCH)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features (no version bump)
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code behavior (no version bump)
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests (no version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation updates (no version bump)
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks (no version bump)

#### Scope

The scope is optional and indicates the part of the codebase affected, e.g., `state`, `derived`, `effect`, `batch`.

#### Summary

- Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period at the end
- Keep it under 72 characters

#### Body

- Explain the motivation for the change
- Use imperative, present tense
- Include relevant context
- Break lines at 72 characters

#### Footer

- Reference issues and PRs: `Fixes #123, Closes #456`
- Note breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description of what breaks and how to migrate`

#### Examples

```
feat(derived): add support for explicit dependency tracking

Add an optional second parameter to derived() that accepts an array
of dependencies to track explicitly, rather than using automatic
dependency detection.

This improves performance in cases where automatic tracking is too
aggressive and provides more control to developers.
```

```
breaking(api): rename effect() to watch()

Function behaves identically but the name better reflects its purpose
and aligns with industry terminology.

BREAKING CHANGE: effect() should be replaced with watch()
```

```
epoch(core): rewrite core reactivity system

Complete overhaul of the internal reactivity system to use proxies
instead of getters/setters for better performance and cleaner API.

BREAKING CHANGE: While the public API remains compatible,
internal APIs are completely different. Extensions using internals
will need to be updated.
```

### Code Formatting

- Follow the coding standards already in place for **@nerdalytics/beacon**.
- Ensure your code is clean, readable, and includes comments where needed.
- Use our formatting tools (e.g., Biome, ESLint) to keep the codebase consistent.

---

## Documentation

- Update the documentation in tandem with code changes.
- If you introduce new features or alter existing functionality, update the README and other relevant docs accordingly.
- Consider adding examples or usage details for clarity.
