# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we as contributors and maintainers of **@nerdalytics/beacon** pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions, comments, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (e.g., GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, chat channels, etc.) and in one-on-one communications when using these spaces. It also applies to interactions occurring outside of these spaces when they directly impact the project or its community.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact a project maintainer immediately at **[insert email/contact here]**. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at the email provided above. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details on specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
